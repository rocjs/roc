### update-settings

Expected to return new settings that should be merged with the existing ones.

Makes it possible to modify the settings object before a command is started and after potential arguments from the command line and configuration file have been parsed. This is a good point to default to some value if no was given or modify something in the settings.

__Initial value:__ _Nothing_  
__Expected return value:__ `{}`
